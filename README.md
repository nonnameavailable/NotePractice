## Features
Currently, this program can display a random note from your selected range and key, which you can then "play" in one of 3 ways.
- Pressing the corresponding letter on a keyboard (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).
- Clicking on the corresponding key on a virtual piano.
- Playing the note on a digital piano connected via USB. - Simply connect your piano to your PC, press the "Input MIDI" button and select your piano.

Your input is evaluated the name of the note is shown in green if played correctly, or in red if played incorrectly.  
You can set the octaves, the key and whether or not the program will generate sharp and flat notes as well.
